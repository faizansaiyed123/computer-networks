# 10 - Layering in Computer Networks

## What is Layering?
- **Layering** means decomposing the problem into more manageable components (layers).

### Advantages
- Provides a more **modular design**.
- Makes troubleshooting **easier**.

---

## Protocols
- A **protocol** is a set of rules that govern data communication.
- The protocol in each layer **controls the activities** of that layerâ€™s communication.

---

## Layered Architecture
- **OSI Reference Model**
- **TCP/IP Model**

---

## The OSI Model
- **OSI** = Open System Interconnection.
- A **model** for understanding and designing a network architecture that is **flexible, robust, and interoperable**.
- Developed by the **International Standards Organization (ISO)**.
- The OSI model is **not a protocol**, it is only a **guideline**, hence called the **OSI Reference Model**.

---

## The TCP/IP Model
- **TCP/IP** = Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol.
- Developed **before** the OSI model.
- Layers in TCP/IP do **not exactly match** those in OSI.
- TCP/IP is a **hierarchical protocol suite** made up of interactive modules, each providing a **specific functionality**.
