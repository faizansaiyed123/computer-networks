# 09 - Switching Techniques in Computer Networks


Switching 
switching in computer network help in deciding the best route for data transmission if there are multiple path in a larger network

one to one connection

switching techniques
circuit switching
message switching
packet switching


1: circuit switching:
a path dedicated path is established between the sender and reciver
before data transfar conection will be established first
example telephone network

3 phases in circuit switching
1. connection establishment
2. data transfar
3. connection disconnection


2: message switching
store and forword mechanisam
message is transfarred as a complete unit and forword using store and forword mechinasam at the intermediary node.
not suited for streaming media and real time applications.


3: Packet Switching
the internet is a packet switched network
message is broken in indivudial chunks called as packet
each packet is sent individully
each packet will have source and destination ip addrss with sequance number.
sequance number will help the reciver to
recordor the packets.
ditect missing packets 
send acknowladgements
