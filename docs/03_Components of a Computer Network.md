# 03 — Components of a Computer Network

## 1. Nodes

### End Nodes (End Devices)
End nodes are the starting or ending points of communication.  
When two devices communicate, one initiates the communication and the other accepts it.  

**Examples:**  
- Computers  
- Network Printers  
- VoIP Phones  
- Telepresence Endpoints  
- Security Cameras  
- Mobile/Handheld Devices: Smartphones, Tablets, PDAs, Wireless Payment Terminals, Barcode Scanners  

### Intermediary Nodes
Intermediary nodes forward data between end devices. They are placed **between end nodes** to ensure data delivery.  

**Examples:**  
- Switches  
- Wireless Access Points  
- Routers  
- Security Devices (Firewalls)  
- Bridges  
- Hubs  
- Repeaters  
- Cell Towers

## 2. Media (Transmission Medium)

Also called **link** — the medium that connects nodes.

### Wired Medium (Guided)
Physical cables are used to connect nodes.  

**Examples:**  
1. Ethernet Straight-through Cable  
2. Ethernet Crossover Cable  
3. Fiber Optic Cable  
4. Coaxial Cable  
5. USB Cable  

### Wireless Medium (Unguided)
No physical cables; data travels through air.  

**Examples:**  
- **Infrared:** TV remote control (short range)  
- **Radio:** Bluetooth, Wi-Fi  
- **Microwaves:** Cellular systems  
- **Satellite:** Long-range communication (GPS)

- Email  
- Storage Services  
- File Sharing  
- Instant Messaging  
- Online Gaming  
- Voice over IP (VoIP)
